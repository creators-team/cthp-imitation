# Corporate Site Imitation Task

## Task
Copy only the top page of [our corporate site](https://creators-team.com/).

## Viewport
Width: 1080px ~ 1440px (PC)
> It would be great if you could implement smartphone-sized one as well!

## Ui that doesn't need to be implemented
- Mouse cursor decoration
- A shadow chasing cursor
- Rotating links
- Blog slides (bottom of the page)

## Fonts
You should use fonts `Noto Sans JP`, `Noto Serif JP` and `Renner*`.

You can easily find out how to use `Noto Sans JP` and `Noto Serif JP` because these fonts are [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com).

`Renner*` can be used by writing as follows in your HTML file.

```HTML
<link href="https://indestructibletype-fonthosting.github.io/renner.css">
<style>
  .any-element{
    font-family: 'Renner*', 'sans-serif';
  }
</style>
```
